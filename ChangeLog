2012-08-25  Richard Murray  <murray@altura.local>

	* tests/rlocus_test.py (TestRootLocus.testRootLocus): added sort()
	to test to get rid of problems in which ordering was generating an
	error.

	* src/freqplot.py (nyquist_plot): added code from Kevin Davies to
	label frequency points in Nyquist plot

	* src/__init__.py: import non-conflicting MATLAB functions by default

	* src/freqplot.py (bode_plot, nyquist_plot): simplified code and
	removed unneeded options.  To set color, linestyle, etc use keywords
	and pass to matplotlib.

2012-08-24  Richard Murray  <murray@altura.local>

	* src/freqplot.py: added in plot enhancements from Kevin Davies
	(bode_plot): pass optional arguments and keywords to matplotlib

	slycot import error.  If not present, use signal.lti to perform the
	conversion.  Only works for SISO.

	* src/statesp.py (_convertToStateSpace): added check for slycot
	import error, to allow basic functionality without the presence of
	slycot (contributed by Ryan Krauss).

	* tests/slycot_convert_test.py (TestSlycot.testTF): moved slycot
	import into test function, so that test script still works even if
	time response is not present.

2011-08-09  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	documentation and reposted on web (note that 0.5a tag and source
	distribution have this wrong)

---- control-0.5a released -----

2011-08-07  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* setup.py: updated version number; next release will be 0.5a since
	the changes in function names and argument/return value order (for
	time reponses) require small updates in code

	* examples/secord-matlab.py, examples/pvtol-nested-ss.py,
	examples/test-response.py, examples/pvtol-nested.py: fixed small bug

	* src/__init__.py: changed import commands to import specific
	functions rather than '*' (better modularity)

	* src/freqplot.py: default function names are now bode_plot,
	nyquist_plot and gangof4_plot (still with aliases to non-"_plot"
	versions)

	* src/nichols.py (nichols_plot): updated nichols to nichols_plot for
	consistency with other python-control plotting functions.  Set up
	alias for original name

	(initial versions just call functions; some comparisons missing)

	* examples/README: added missing README file

	* examples/phaseplots.py: FBS examples for phaseplot

	* tests/phaseplot_test.py: unit tests for phaseplot

	* src/phaseplot.py: initial cut at phase portrait function, built
	from amphaseplot (Feeback Systems [FBS], Astrom and Murray, 2008)

2011-07-15  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* tests/matlab_test.py (TestMatlab): added unittest for margin()
	commands (calling format only)

	* src/statesp.py (StateSpace): updated comments

	* tests/margin_test.py: set up unit tests for StabilityMargins() and
	PhaseCrossoverFrequencies()

	* src/__init__.py: added margins.py to __init__

2011-07-14  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/margins.py (GainPhaseMargin): moved freqplot.MarginPlot to
	margin.StabilityMargins (MarginPlot didn't actually plot anything)

	* src/margins.py (PhaseCrossoverFrequencies): added new function to
	compute frequencies that we cross real axis.  Contributed by Steffen
	Waldherr <waldherr@ist.uni-stuttgart.de>

2011-07-11  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/rlocus.py: added real() and imag() to list of functions
	imported from numpy

	* src/freqplot.py: renamed plotting functions to BodePlot,
	NyquistPlot, GangOf4Plot and MarginPlot.  Set up aliases to the more

	around with idea for the eventual interface to use.

	* tests/matlab_test.py: updated timeresp outputs to match MATLAB

	* src/matlab.py (impulse, initial, lsim, step): switched outputs
	from step, impulse, initial, lsim to match MATLAB standard

2011-07-01  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/rlocus.py: modified scipy import to only import those
	functions that we actually use.  This fixes a problem pointed out by
	Carsten Knoll (TU Dresden) where control.place could be overwritten
	by numpy.place (because of an "from scipy import *" in rlocus.py

	* doc/intro.rst: Added link to scipy web page talking about the
	differences between numpy and MATLAB (contributed by Shuo Han).

2011-06-25  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/xferfcn.py (TransferFunction._common_den): changed tolerance
	for detecting complex valued poles to a user-settable parameter,
	with default value 1e-8.  This was an attempt to fix errors in the
	convert_test.py unittest script (conversion routine was
	misclassifying some poles as imaginary when they weren't).

	* src/xferfcn.py (_convertToTransferFunction): converted arguments
	to tb04ad to numpy arrays; fixes a unit test error in convert_test.py.

	* src/statefbk.py (gram): convert system matrix passed to sb03md to
	numpy array; this fixes a unit test error in modelsimp_test.py.

	* src/matlab.py (impulse): got rid of X0 argument for impulse
	response (not implemented in MATLAB).

	* doc/intro.rst: added some quick start information

	pointer to the python-control wiki (on sf.net)

	* doc/Makefile: Changed path to sphinx-build to assume it is in the
	users path (as opposed to an explicit path)

	* doc/conf.py: Added release information into documentation file

2011-06-21  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/statesp.py (_mimo2siso): Moved function from matlab.py.

	* src/timeresp.py: added file documentation + split out and updated
	copyright info.  Small corrections to documentation.
	(InitialResponse): Added missing transpose argument in call to
	ForcedResponse 

	* src/matlab.py: minor changes to documentation to avoid line wraps
	on standard (80 col) terminal window

	* src/matlab.py: removed time-series convention documentation from
	matlab.py since current MATLAB version uses standard conventions.
	This documentation is currently in timeresp.py.

	* src/*, doc/*: added Eike Welk's documentation modifications

2011-06-18  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/timeresp.py, src/matlab.py: moved documentation about time
	series convention from matlab.py to timeresp.py

	* examples/pvtol-nested-ss.py: Fixed bug in call to step (wrong
	second argument)

	* tests/matlab_test.py: Updated tests to use MATLAB time response
	conventions.

	* tests/timeresp_test.py: Created unit tests for timeresp module,
	based on matlab_test.py

2011-06-17  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/timeresp.py (ForcedResponse): swapped order of input and time
	arguments for linear response, following Eike's comment "T must
	always be supplied by the user, but U has a useful default value of
	0." 

	* src/matlab.py: moved code for lsim, initial, step, and impulse to
	timeresp.py and put in new routes that call timeresp.* versions of
	the functions with transposeData set to True.

	* src/timesim.py (_check_convert_array): added transpose argument
	that will transpose input data before processing it.

	* src/timesim.py: renamed lsim, initial, step, and impulse functions
	to ForcedResponse, InitialResponse, StepResponse and
	ImpulseResponse.  These versions use Eike Welk's input ordering.

	* examples/pvtol-nested.py: calls to step() had screwed up inputs.
	Fixed. 

2011-06-17  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/matlab.py: added MIMO extensions from Eike Welk on 12 Jun
	2011: adds MIMO capabilities for ``lsim``, ``step``, ``impulse``,
	``initial`` 

	* src/matlab.py: added changes from Eike Welk on 12 May 2011:

	  - An implementation of the four simulation functions ``lsim``,
  	    ``step``, ``initial``, and ``impulse`` of the module ``matlab``. 

          - Adds a function ``dcgain`` to the ``matlab`` module, which
  	    computes the gain of a linear system for steady state and
	    constant input. 

          - The patch contains a bug fix for class ``StateSpace``, which
	    enables it to work properly together with Scipy's ``signal``
	    module.  

          - The simulation functions' return values are changed (back?) to
	    arrays, because matrices confuse Matplotlib.

	  - New times series convention: see _time-series-convention section
 	    of matlab documentation

	  - SISO simulation data are squeezed on output.  To turn this off,
	    pass the option squeeze=False

---- control-0.4c released -----

2011-06-17  Richard Murray  <murray@dhcp096.fhl.washington.edu>

	* examples/tfvis.py: Added tfvis, Simple GUI application for
	visualizing how the poles/zeros of the transfer function effects the
	bode, nyquist and step response of a SISO system.  Contributed by
	Vanessa Romero Segovia, Ola Johnsson, Jerker Nordh.

2011-06-16  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/matlab.py: import mateqn functions

	* src/__init__.py: import mateqn functions

	* tests/test_all.py: added unit tests for matrix solvers, converting
	to standard format along the way.  Seems to work even if slycot
	routines are not in place, but I'm not sure if this is for the right
	reasons...

	* src/mateqn.py: added matrix solvers from LTH (Ola Johnsson, Jerker
	Nordh, Bjorn Olofsson, Vanessa Romero).  Moved slycot function
	checks to the portion of the code where they are used, so that
	missing slycot doesn't mess up initialization if proper version of
	slycot is not available.

2011-04-02  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/xferfcn.py (TransferFunction.__add__): fixed bug when adding a
	transfer function to state space system; _convertToTransferFunction
	was being called with input/output keywords.  Picked up in unit test.

	* tests/matlab_test.py: added calls to all of the functions that are
	currently implemented in the library, to make sure there are no
	hidden issues.  These calls do *not* test functionality, they just
	make sure that MATLAB compatibility functions accept the right types
	of arguments.

	* examples/secord-matlab.py: added root locus plot to list of
	figures that are produced

	* src/__init__.py: added rlocus to list of modules that are imported
	by control module

	* src/exception.py (ControlMIMONotImplemented): added exception for
	functions that are not yet implemented for MIMO systems

	* src/xferfcn.py (TransferFunction.__init__): convert integer
	numerator and denominator objects to floats to eliminate errors when
	creating common denominator (also used on pole command).  This fixes
	and error were tf([1], [1, 2, 1]).pole() would generate an error.

	* src/freqplot.py (bode): Tweaked documentation string to remove 'h'
	from mag and phase return arguments

	* src/rlocus.py (RootLocus): removed commands that set figure number
	inside of RootLocus command, for consistency with other frequency
	plot routines.  Added Plot=True argument and updated documentation.

	* src/matlab.py: added rlocus() command (calls RootLocus)

	* MANIFEST.in: Added MANIFEST.in file to include examples and tests
	in source distribution

	* README: Updated to include information on how to run unit tests.

	* setup.py: updated version number to 0.4c

---- control-0.4b released -----

2011-04-02  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/__init__.py: removed import of tests module (moved to tests/)

	* src/matlab.py: Added hsvd, balred, modred to list of functions
	that are imported for use as is.  Updated documentation string to
	indicate that these are implemented, along with a few other
	functions (zero, lqr) that weren't properly listed.

	* src/modelsimp.py (balred): Removed extraneous print statements
	(modred): Set method to be 'matchdc' by default (to match MATLAB)

	* src/__init__.py: added missing import of modelsimp functions

	* tests/slycot_convert_test.py (TestSlycot.testTF): turned off print
	statements in unit test to make it easier to see results.  Use
	verbose=True to turn back on.

	* tests/convert_test.py (TestConvert.testConvert): got rid of print
	statements in unittest; clutters the output so that you can't see
	the errors clearly.  Use verbose=True to turn back on.

	* src/statesp.py (_convertToStateSpace): removed "buggy" print
	statements 

	* src/xferfcn.py (_convertToTransferFunction): removed "buggy" print
	statements 

	* tests/nichols_test.py (TestStateSpace.testNgrid): updated testcode
	to turn off grid in initial Nichols chart plot.

	* src/freqplot.py: updated comments at top of file to reflect
	nichols chart move

	* src/nichols.py: transferred over changes from v0.3d

	* src/matlab.py (ngrid): moved import to function

2011-03-31  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* examples/pvtol-nested.py: updated stability margin plot to use
	proper calling format for bode().

	* src/statesp.py (_convertToStateSpace): moved slycot import
	to the location where it is actually needed (allows running some
	commands without slycot installed)

	* src/xferfcn.py (_convertToTransferFunction): moved slycot import
	to the location where it is actually needed (allows running some
	commands without slycot installed)

	* src/nichols.py: new file for Nichols plot routines; move
	nichols(), nichols_grid(), closed_loop_contours(), m_circles(),
	n_circles()

	* src/__init__.py, src/freqresp.py, src/matlab.py: updated to match
	new file structure for Nichols charts

	* src/nichols.py (nichols): updated processing of freqresp to take
	into account the fact that return arguments are now a matrix of
	results (even for a SISO system)

2011-03-30  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* tests/: added top level subdirectory, to be used for unit tests.
	The idea in putting the code here is that you can do 'setup.py test'
	during installation to make sure everything is working correctly.
	The test code would normally *not* be callable from the installed
	module. 

	* tests/*_test.py: moved from src/Test*.py

	* setup.py: updated version number.

2011-02-13  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/*.py: added svn:keywords Id properly

	functiality + split out some of the nichols chart code into separate
	functions

2011-02-12  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* setup.py: updated version number to 0.4a

2010-11-05  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* external/yottalab.py: New file containing Roberto Bucher's control
	library functions.  OK to start pulling these into the main library,
	with attribution, but note that they use modifications of the
	default library => some rewrites will be needed.

2010-09-11  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/matlab.py (step): Added local step response function that uses
	lsim2() instead of signal.step (which can't handle integrators).
	This function may not be needed when new scipy step2() function is
	available.
	(impulse): Added local impulse response function that sets the
	initial condition based on the input matrix and then uses the
	lsim2() function to compute the response.

	* examples/test-response.py: Added test script for making sure that
	time repsonse functions are working as desired

	* src/matlab.py (lsim): Added local version of lsim that calls
	signal.lsim2 (actual ODE integrator)

2010-09-06  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/statefbk.py (ctrb): new function for testing controllability
	* src/statefbk.py (obsv): new function for testing observabiilty

2010-09-02  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/statefbk.py (place): Use np.size() instead of len() for
	finding length of placed_eigs for better compatability with
	different python versions [courtesy of Roberto Bucher]

	* src/delay.py (pade): New file for delay-based computations +
	initial implementation of pade() [courtesy Sawyer Fuller]

2010-06-17  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/rlocus.py: changed num, den to nump, denp for clarity
	* src/rlocus.py: new file with Ryan Krauss's root locus code

2010-06-06  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* examples/pvtol-lqr.py: Added example to test out LQR routines

	* src/matlab.py (bode): created a wrapper that allows MATLAB style
	arguments for bode (eg, bode(sys1, sys2))

	* src/ctrlutil.py (issys): added new function to check if an object
	is a system (state space or transfer function).  Will generalize
	this latter to look for other compatible classes.

	* src/freqplot.py (bode): Compute frequency range of bode plot based
	on poles and zeros
	(bode): Allow bode plot to be passed a list (or tuple) as the first
	argument, in which case multiple bode plots are generated

	* src/statesp.py (StateSpace.zeros): new function to compute zeros
	for a state space system
	(StateSpace): defined new functions to compute poles of a state
	space system

	* src/xferfcn.py (TransferFunction): defined new functions to
	compute poles and zeros of a transfer function.

2010-05-31  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/exception.py (ControlNotImplemented): added new exception, to
	be used for functions that are not yet implemented

	* src/statefbk.py (lqr): added lqr function (using slycot).  Still
	needs to be verified to make sure calculations are correct.

	* ChangeLog: converted to standard GNU formation (old style below)
	* setup.py: updated package number to v0.3, changed URL to
	sourceforge wiki
