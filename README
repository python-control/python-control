Python Control System Library
RMM, 23 May 09

This directory contains the source code for the Python Control Systems
Library (python-control).  This library is still under development,
but is intended to serve as a wrapper for standard control system
algorithms in the python programming environment.

Installation instructions
-------------------------
Standard python package installation:

  python setup.py install

To see if things are working, you can run the script
examples/secord-matlab.py (using ipython -pylab).  It should generate
a step response, Bode plot and Nyquist plot for a simple second order
linear system.

You can also run a set of unit tests to make sure that everything is
working correctly.  After installation, run

  python tests/test_all.py

from the source distribution directory.
